# OCP-Profiles
This repository contains OCP Profiles.

OCP has designation the Redfish standard for the out-of-band manageability interface for OCP platforms. The Redfish standard is development by [DMTF Redfish Forum](http://dmtf.org/redfish) and their alliance partners.

A profile is a JSON document which prescribes a subset of Redfish resource and resource properties required be supported by an implementation.  The profile can be read by the [Redfish Interop Validator](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Interop-Validator), which will test a implementation for conformance to the profile.

The format of the profile file is specified by the [Redfish Interoperability Profile Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0272_1.4.0.pdf)

The profiles at the root of the repository have been approved by OCP Incubation Committee. The profiles in the subfolders are still being developed by the associated project.

If issues are found, please an issue to this repository.
